# Emotion-Detector2.0
Its my second version of Emotion Detector cause somehow the last one didn't end up really well!
The following code is capable of detecting emotions almost 70% - 80% correctly when you are facing directly towards the camera. In this project everything is well defined so that you can easily understand what I have done in the code! And yeah also, it is live emotion detector which use "webcam" as a source of input.

# Warning
This is one of my earlist project that I have made so far! I made this project way before uploading in "github".(Anyways!) I am here to clearfy that the file "fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102......" that is used in this repository is a pre-trained model! "main.py" was completely written by me, back then I didn't know how to train a model! (Also I would really love to mention the creator of this model but I don't remember the name or account of model creator!).
